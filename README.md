# holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

Small collection of introductory Python exercises for the Holberton curriculum. Each folder below includes a short README and runnable scripts to practice core language concepts.

## Structure
- [python-hello_world](python-hello_world/): first steps with printing, strings, and basic formatting.
- [python-if_else_loops_functions](python-if_else_loops_functions/): conditionals, loops, simple functions, and classic fizzbuzz.
- [python-import_modules](python-import_modules/): importing functions, variables, and exploring module attributes.

## How to run
1. Use Python 3: `python3 script.py`
2. Scripts are self-contained; no extra dependencies are required.
3. Check each subfolder README for script-specific notes.
