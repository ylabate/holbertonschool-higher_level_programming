Test for task_03_countediterator module
========================================

>>> from task_03_countediterator import CountedIterator

Basic iteration with a list
============================

>>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> counted_iter = CountedIterator(data)
>>> next(counted_iter)
1
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
1
>>> next(counted_iter)
2
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
2
>>> next(counted_iter)
3
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
3
>>> next(counted_iter)
4
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
4

StopIteration exception when no more items
===========================================

>>> next(counted_iter)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
StopIteration

Counter should remain at last value
===================================

>>> counted_iter.get_count()
4

Iteration with a string
=======================

>>> counted_iter = CountedIterator("ABC")
>>> next(counted_iter)
'A'
>>> next(counted_iter)
'B'
>>> next(counted_iter)
'C'
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
3

Iteration with a range
======================

>>> counted_iter = CountedIterator(range(1, 4))
>>> next(counted_iter)
1
>>> next(counted_iter)
2
>>> next(counted_iter)
3
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
3
>>> next(counted_iter)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
StopIteration

Using in a while loop
=====================

>>> counted_iter = CountedIterator([10, 20, 30])
>>> try:
...     while True:
...         item = next(counted_iter)
...         print(f"Got {item}, total {counted_iter.get_count()} items iterated.")
... except StopIteration:
...     print("No more items.")
Got 10, total 1 items iterated.
Got 20, total 2 items iterated.
Got 30, total 3 items iterated.
No more items.

Empty iterator
==============

>>> counted_iter = CountedIterator([])
>>> next(counted_iter)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
StopIteration
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
0

Using with tuple
================

>>> counted_iter = CountedIterator((100, 200, 300))
>>> next(counted_iter)
100
>>> next(counted_iter)
200
>>> next(counted_iter)
300
>>> counted_iter.get_count()
3
