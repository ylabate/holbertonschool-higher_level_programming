import:
	>>> VerboseList = __import__('task_02_verboselist').VerboseList

Instantiate a VerboseList object:
	>>> vl = VerboseList()

Test append method with single item:
	>>> vl.append(1)
	Added [1] to the list.

Test append method with another item:
	>>> vl.append(2)
	Added [2] to the list.

Test append method with string:
	>>> vl.append("hello")
	Added [hello] to the list.

Verify list contents after appends:
	>>> print(vl)
	[1, 2, 'hello']

Test extend method with list:
	>>> vl.extend([3, 4, 5])
	Extended the list with [3] items.

Test extend method with single item list:
	>>> vl.extend([99])
	Extended the list with [1] items.

Verify list contents after extends:
	>>> print(vl)
	[1, 2, 'hello', 3, 4, 5, 99]

Test remove method:
	>>> vl.remove(2)
	Removed [2] from the list.

Test remove method with string:
	>>> vl.remove("hello")
	Removed [hello] from the list.

Verify list contents after removes:
	>>> print(vl)
	[1, 3, 4, 5, 99]

Test pop method with index 0:
	>>> vl.pop(0)
	Popped [1] from the list.
	1

Test pop method with index 1:
	>>> vl.pop(1)
	Popped [4] from the list.
	4

Verify list contents after pops:
	>>> print(vl)
	[3, 5, 99]

Test append on fresh list:
	>>> vl2 = VerboseList([10, 20])
	>>> vl2.append(30)
	Added [30] to the list.

Test extend with multiple items:
	>>> vl2.extend([40, 50, 60])
	Extended the list with [3] items.

Test remove on initialized list:
	>>> vl2.remove(20)
	Removed [20] from the list.

Verify contents of vl2:
	>>> print(vl2)
	[10, 30, 40, 50, 60]

Test pop with default index (last element):
	>>> vl2.pop()
	Popped [60] from the list.
	60

Verify final contents of vl2:
	>>> print(vl2)
	[10, 30, 40, 50]

Test pop with index from main example:
	>>> vl3 = VerboseList([1, 2, 3])
	>>> vl3.append(4)
	Added [4] to the list.
	>>> vl3.extend([5, 6])
	Extended the list with [2] items.
	>>> vl3.remove(2)
	Removed [2] from the list.
	>>> vl3.pop()
	Popped [6] from the list.
	6
	>>> vl3.pop(0)
	Popped [1] from the list.
	1

Verify final contents of vl3:
	>>> print(vl3)
	[3, 4, 5]
